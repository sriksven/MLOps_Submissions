# FastAPI Lab - Iris Classifier API


## ðŸ”„ Enhancements Over Original Lab

When I first started with the lab, the FastAPI application was very minimal; it only returned an integer class label inside a basic response model. The /predict endpoint simply gave me something like { "response": 2 }, and there was no way to retrain the model without running train.py manually. Also, predictions werenâ€™t being tracked anywhere, and error handling was limited. It was a good starting point, but I wanted to push it further and make it more realistic.

So, I made several enhancements to improve both functionality and usability:

I updated the /predict endpoint to return not just the class label but also the probability scores, so I can see how confident the model is for each prediction.

I built a logging system that automatically appends every prediction into prediction_log.csv with timestamp, input features, predicted class, and probabilities. This way, I can audit or review past predictions anytime.

I added a new /retrain endpoint, which triggers train.py via subprocess, allowing me to retrain the model directly from the API instead of running scripts manually.

I also improved error handling by wrapping the logic in try/except blocks and raising HTTPException when something goes wrong, so that API users get clear error messages instead of raw crashes.

This project serves a trained Decision Tree Classifier on the Iris dataset as a REST API using **FastAPI** and **Uvicorn**.
